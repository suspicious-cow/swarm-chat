## What is Swarm Chat?

Swarm Chat is a group discussion platform designed for large-group deliberation. Instead of putting everyone into one overwhelming chat room, you're placed in a small group of ~5 people called a **ThinkTank**. Meanwhile, AI agents work behind the scenes to share the best ideas between all the groups — so you get the benefit of hearing everyone's perspectives without the chaos of a massive conversation.

Think of it like breakout rooms in a meeting, except the groups are connected by an AI that makes sure no great idea stays stuck in just one room.

## Joining a Session

1. Open the Swarm Chat URL in your browser (your facilitator will provide this — usually something like `http://localhost:3000` or a custom domain)
2. On the lobby page, find the **Join a Session** card
3. Enter the **join code** your facilitator gave you — it's a 6-character code like `A3X9K2`
4. Enter your **display name** (this is how other people in your group will see you)
5. Click **Join Session**

That's it! You're in.

## The Waiting Room

After joining, you'll land in a waiting room. Here you'll see:

- The **deliberation topic** — the question or subject everyone will be discussing
- The **join code** displayed prominently (in case a latecomer needs it)
- Your name and role

**Just wait here.** When the facilitator is ready and enough people have joined, they'll start the deliberation. You'll **automatically transition** to the chat room — no need to refresh or click anything.

## Chatting in Your ThinkTank

Once the deliberation starts, you'll be placed in your ThinkTank — a small group chat with about 5 people.

**The chat layout:**

- **Main area** (left): All messages in your group, appearing in real time
  - Your ThinkTank name and the topic are shown at the top (e.g., "ThinkTank 1")
  - Your own messages appear on the right side in a highlighted color
  - Other people's messages appear on the left
- **Sidebar** (right): Shows the list of members in your group
- **Message input** (bottom): Type your message and click **Send** or press **Enter**

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- **Enter** — Send your message
- **Shift+Enter** — Add a new line without sending

## Understanding AI Messages

As you chat, you'll notice some messages with special badges. These are from AI agents — don't worry, they're here to help, not to take over the conversation.

### AI RELAY

Messages marked with an **"AI RELAY"** badge are from the **Surrogate Agent**. This is the core feature of Swarm Chat. The Surrogate Agent reads what other ThinkTanks are talking about and brings those ideas into your conversation, phrased naturally:

> *"I've been hearing from other groups that some people are concerned about the impact on small businesses..."*

> *"Some folks elsewhere raised an interesting point about how transit alternatives would need to be in place first..."*

**How to interact with AI RELAY messages:**
- Treat them like you would any other participant's comment
- Agree, disagree, build on the idea, or ask follow-up questions
- These messages are how you learn what other groups are thinking — engaging with them makes the whole deliberation better

### AI

Messages with an **"AI"** badge are from the **Contributor Agent**, which may ask thought-provoking questions or raise perspectives that nobody has mentioned yet. (This feature may not be active in every session.)

## Using the Visualizer

If you see a **Visualizer** button in the header bar, you can click it to get a bird's-eye view of the entire deliberation:

- **Deliberation Map**: Circles represent each ThinkTank, showing how many members are in each
- **Connections**: Lines between ThinkTanks show that ideas are flowing between them
- **Live Ideas**: A sidebar lists all the ideas the AI has extracted from every group, with sentiment indicators:
  - Green = supportive sentiment
  - Red = opposing sentiment

Click **Chat** in the header to return to your group conversation.

## Tips for Great Deliberation

1. **Share your honest perspective** — the whole point is to hear diverse viewpoints
2. **Respond to others** — don't just post your opinion in isolation; build on what people say, agree, or respectfully push back
3. **Engage with AI RELAY messages** — these are ideas from other groups and deserve the same attention as messages from people in your group
4. **Keep messages focused** — shorter, clearer messages work better than long paragraphs
5. **Stay on topic** — the AI works best when it can identify clear, distinct ideas in the conversation
6. **Be respectful** — you're deliberating with real people across multiple groups

## FAQ

**How many people are in my group?**
Usually about 5, though it can range from 3-10 depending on how the facilitator configured the session.

**Can I see what other groups are saying?**
Not directly — but the AI RELAY messages bring the key ideas from other groups into your conversation. You can also use the Visualizer to see a high-level overview of all extracted ideas.

**Who is the "AI RELAY"?**
It's an automated agent (not a real person) that summarizes interesting ideas from other ThinkTanks and introduces them naturally into your group's chat. It helps ensure every group benefits from the full range of perspectives.

**Can I switch groups?**
No — group assignments are fixed for the duration of the session. This is by design: keeping groups stable allows deeper conversation.

**How long does a session last?**
That's up to the facilitator. Sessions can be as short as 10 minutes or run for an hour or more.

**What happens when the session ends?**
The facilitator clicks "End Deliberation," and all participants are notified. The facilitator may then generate an AI summary of the key themes and conclusions from across all groups.

**Do I need to install anything?**
No. Swarm Chat runs entirely in your web browser. Just open the URL and join.

**Is my data saved?**
Messages and extracted ideas are stored for the duration of the session. The facilitator controls the server and data retention. Ask your facilitator about their data policies.
